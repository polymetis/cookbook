#Cookbook

##Your very own Cook Book that is friendly with Cutlery, mainly forks. 

###The Idea

Today I was chatting with the incomparable [Scarlett Sparks](https://github.com/ScarlettSparks) about unconventional uses of GitHub and we did a little Carrot cake recipe and improvement through the pull request system. Then then the idea came to me that why not use GitHub Pages to make a historied, forkable, cook book that we can share our recipes with both the world and other GitHubbers. 

So that is what this is. 

###How do I share this

You fork the project and then the will share the like username.github.com/cookbook. Simple.

###Why not a wiki

GitHub is user centred and so our tastes in food. That does not stop us from using the pull request system to make better recipes but if a fork is need then you still have a clean cook book that is focused on your tastes. 

A wiki on the other hand assumes some sort of canon which is only the place of 3 Michelin Star restaurants.   

So ... GitHub already made our code better lets make a our food better too.
